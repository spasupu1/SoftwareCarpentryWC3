Hello Guys,
Did you friend challenged you to find sum of all the even numbers between some two random numbers?
Do not dare doing it on the calculator as it gonna take a few hourse before you get the answer.

We are here for the rescue, We made an app which takes the 2 numbers and finds the sum of even numbers between them.
Sounds Good!

Then why wait, open the repository and use the python script we made.
